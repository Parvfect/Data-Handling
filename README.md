## Physics Lab Scripts
This repository contains a collection of useful scripts developed during my second year physics laboratory module. The scripts are designed to assist with data analysis, visualization, and general experimentation tasks.

## Contents
1. Data processing scripts for common lab experiments
2. Plotting tools for visualizing measurements and results
3. Utilities for error analysis and fitting curves to experimental data
